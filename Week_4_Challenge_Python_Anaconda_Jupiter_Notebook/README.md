# School_District_Analysis
Week 4, Anaconda, Jupiter Notebook, Python

## Overview of the School District Analysis: 
In the initial part of the analysis, the purpose was to provide insights about schools performance, trends and patterns based on data about funding and standardized test scores. The information was given as per student scores, and in the analysis it was aggregated in various ways to provide insights. The funding data was also analyzed in various ways to better understand if and how funding impacts school performance. The analysis is intended to inform discussions at the district and school level regarding budget and priorities. 

In the second part (the challenge) the original analysis was modified after discovering that a subset of the students grades have been altered. Specifically the math and reading grades for Thomas High School 9th graders. In the new analysis, these grades were eliminated while the rest of the data remained intact. This report describes how eliminating these grades impacts the overall analysis.

## Results:

After all the grades for 9th grade were replaced by Nan, there was a significant drop in the percentage of students in the school that passed the standardized tests. Both math and reading. When calculating the percentages of students that passed the tests, the student name column was used to count the students. This included all the students in the school including the 9th graders. With their grades being switched to "nothing" the percentage of students that passed changed significantly. 
```
# Calculate the number of students passing math and passing reading by school.
per_school_passing_math = per_school_passing_math.groupby(["school_name"]).count()["student_name"]
per_school_passing_reading = per_school_passing_reading.groupby(["school_name"]).count()["student_name"]

# Calculate the percentage of passing math and reading scores per school.
per_school_passing_math = per_school_passing_math / per_school_counts * 100
per_school_passing_reading = per_school_passing_reading / per_school_counts * 100

```

### The Change in Thomas High Schoolâ€™s Performance Relative to the Other Schools:

Before replacing the grades, Thomas High School was ranked number 2 after Cabrera High School. After the change, Thomas High School dropped to number 8 with much lower overall passing percentages. 

```
# Sort and show top five schools.
top_schools = per_school_summary_df.sort_values(["% Overall Passing"], ascending=False)

top_schools.head()
```

### Effect on Math and Reading Scores by Grade:

Math and reading score by grade all grades would remain the same, except that in the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School there are no grades. It is Nan (=not a number) where originally it was 83.6.

### Effect on Scores by School Spending

The first dataframe is showing the data prior to the change. the second dataframe is showing the numbers after the changes. Thomas High school was in the third bracket with $638 spending per student. Reducing the passing percentages for Thomas High School reduced the passing percentages for that third bracket.
